# Bubble sort

```c
#include "sort.h"
```
This line includes the header file "sort.h". The header file likely contains function prototypes and any necessary definitions for the sorting functions used in this program.

```c
/**
 *swap - a function that swaps two integers.
 *@a: first integer to swap.
 *@b: second integer to swap.
 *
 * Return: void.
 */
```
This is a function comment block, documenting the `swap` function. It explains what the function does and provides information about its parameters and return value. The `swap` function is intended to swap the values of two integers and takes two integer pointers (`a` and `b`) as parameters. It does not return anything (`void`).

```c
void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int x;

    x = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = x;
}
```
This is the implementation of the `swap` function. It uses a temporary variable `x` to swap the values of the integers pointed to by `a` and `b`. After the swapping, `a` will point to the value that was originally stored in `b`, and `b` will point to the value that was originally stored in `a`.

```c
/**
 *bubble_sort - a function that sorts an array using
 *using bubble sort algorithm.
 *@array: the array to be sorted.
 *@size: the size of the array.
 *Return: void.
 */
```
Similar to before, this is a function comment block for the `bubble_sort` function. It provides information about what the function does and describes its parameters and return value. The `bubble_sort` function is intended to sort an integer array (`array`) using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The parameter `size` specifies the size of the array. The function does not return anything (`void`).

```c
void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i, j;

    if (array == NULL || size == 0)
        return;
```
The `bubble_sort` function begins with the declaration of two variables, `i` and `j`, both of type `size_t`, which are used for loop indices.

Next, the function checks if the `array` is `NULL` or if its size is 0. If either of these conditions is true, the function immediately returns without performing any sorting, as there is nothing to sort.

```c
    for (i = size - 1; i > 0; i--)
    {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        {
            if (array[j - 1] > array[j])
            {
                swap(&array[j - 1], &array[j]);
                print_array(array, size);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The nested loops here implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.

The outer loop runs from `size - 1` down to 1. It represents the number of passes the algorithm will make over the array.

The inner loop runs from 1 to `i`. It represents the comparison and swapping phase of Bubble Sort within each pass. As mentioned before, the inner loop starts from 1 because the largest element in each pass will "bubble up" to its correct position, so we don't need to check the last element after each iteration of the outer loop.

Within the inner loop, the function compares the element at index `j - 1` with the element at index `j`. If the element at `j - 1` is greater than the element at `j`, it means they are out of order. In that case, the `swap` function is called to swap the elements, effectively "bubbling up" the larger element.

After each swap, the `print_array` function (not shown in this code snippet) is called to print the current state of the array. This can be useful to visualize the sorting process.

The Bubble Sort algorithm will continue until the array is completely sorted, and the largest element has "bubbled up" to its correct position.
